# Sensor_Data_Analysis
Performed data cleaning procedures, including handling missing values and normalization, using NumPy and Pandas to ensure accuracy and reliability of sensor dataset.
Predicted the amount of heat lost by electric motors during their normal operation using a linear regression model and evaluated its predictive accuracy using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Created scatter plots with Matplotlib to visualize the data and model predictions, and leveraged Power BI for interactive dashboards and reports.
